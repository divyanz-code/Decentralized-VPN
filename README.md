# Decentralized VPN Smart Contract

## Project Title
**Decentralized VPN (dVPN) - Blockchain-Powered Privacy Network**

## Project Description
The Decentralized VPN project is a blockchain-based VPN service built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. This innovative solution enables node operators to provide bandwidth and VPN services to users while earning token rewards for their contributions. The smart contract manages node registration, bandwidth tracking, token distribution, and network statistics, creating a trustless and transparent ecosystem for decentralized internet privacy.

Unlike traditional centralized VPN services, this dVPN eliminates single points of failure, censorship risks, and privacy concerns by distributing the network across multiple independent node operators who are incentivized through tokenized rewards.

### Token Rewards Calculation
```
Tokens Earned = Bandwidth Provided (GB) × Reward Rate (10 tokens/GB)
```

### Example Scenarios
| Bandwidth Provided | Tokens Earned | USD Value (@ $0.10/token) |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 10 GB             | 100 tokens    | $10.00                   |
| 100 GB            | 1,000 tokens  | $100.00                  |
| 1 TB (1024 GB)    | 10,240 tokens | $1,024.00               |
| 10 TB             | 102,400 tokens| $10,240.00              |

### Network Economics
- **Total Supply**: To be determined by tokenomics model
- **Distribution**: 80% to operators, 15% to ecosystem fund, 5% to team
- **Inflation Rate**: 2-5% annually to sustain rewards
- **Burn Mechanism**: 1% of user payments burned to create deflationary pressure
